    "llm_reasoning": "The paper focuses on continual federated learning, which involves learning new tasks or concepts while retaining knowledge from previous tasks. The CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets are suitable for this task as they involve image classification, which is a common domain for evaluating continual learning methods. CIFAR-10 can be used as the primary dataset with its 10 classes representing the initial task, while CIFAR-100 can be used to introduce new tasks or concepts with its 100 classes. The paper's proposed method can be evaluated on how well it learns the new classes from CIFAR-100 while retaining performance on the CIFAR-10 classes.",
