6ej63JkBP8oloYi_7SI_,LeanAttention: Hardware-Aware Scalable Attention Mechanism for the Decode-Phase of Transformers,accept,"The paper is relevant to current LLM, AI, and ML research as it addresses the performance and efficiency challenges of the attention mechanism in Transformer-based models, which are widely used in large language models. The proposed LeanAttention mechanism introduces a novel approach to redesigning the attention execution flow for the decode-phase, which can provide significant speedups in attention computation, especially for long context lengths. This represents a novel technique that could be beneficial for improving the performance and scalability of large language models.",,
