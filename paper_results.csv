NehUW5oBclM7MZc3lpNY,Diffusion Transformers for Tabular Data Time Series Generation,accept,"The paper is relevant as it proposes a Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) approach for tabular data time series generation, which is related to LLM/AI/ML work. The method is novel as it extends the DiTs framework to handle heterogeneous data and variable-length sequences, beyond the state of the art. However, the abstract lacks details on the specific implementation, so the Trainium compatibility is unclear.",,
xehIZpoBclM7MZc3A5PC,CR-CTC: Consistency regularization on CTC for improved speech recognition,accept,"The paper is relevant as it proposes a new CTC-based speech recognition method (CR-CTC) that improves upon the standard CTC. The novelty is in the consistency regularization technique, which provides credible evidence of improved performance. The method is compatible with Trainium as it is expressed in PyTorch and uses standard transformer-compatible operations.",,
